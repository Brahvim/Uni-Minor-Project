# Esp32CamOv2640Working2025
Name sounds like a YouTube tutorial, but when you follow the Debian philosophy, you try to always *only* **do what works**.  
PS this works on *both* IDF v5.3.1 and IDF v5.5.1.  
**Make sure to change paths in `.vscode/settings.json`!**  
PS if you want *only* the capturing code and networking stuff is too much, check out [the `main` branch!](https://github.com/Brahvim/Esp32CamOv2640Working2025/tree/main)
